# DESTINATION UNKNOWN

## Description: 
    A travel site that provides flights based only off of your dates of travel and your home airport. Once a flight is selected then information on the country of the flight would be provided such as the flag, surrounding countries, weather and vaccination requirements to determine if that is a trip you would like to take. The user can refer back to past country searches by clicking on the history button. There they will find the previous information as well as a currency calculator to use while in the country to determine how much things actually cost in the home countries currency. 

## User Story:
    AS AN adventurous individual.
    I WANT  to explore new locations when immediately available. I want to obtain useful information on the country I intend to visit. 
    SO THAT I can plan my trip accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria:
    GIVEN a travel dashboard with form inputs
    WHEN I input my home airport and my dates for my departure and return
    THEN I am  presented with a list of flights that meet my specified criteria
    WHEN I select a flight
    THEN I am provided with facts about the country of which the flight is flying to and the country is added to my search history
    WHEN I click on the country in the search history
    THEN I am again presented with the facts of that country 
    WHEN I click on the button for the currency calculator
    THEN I can determine how much something would cost in a foreign country in my home currency
